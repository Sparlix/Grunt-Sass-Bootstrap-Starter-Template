## BUILD ROUTE FOR GRUNT TASKS

THE BUILD CURRENT IS AS SHOWN


## SCSS Compile Docs
ALL SCSS FILES COMPILE INTO 'style.scss'

'style.scss' than get processed into css via grunt and 
is stored under
assets\css\style.css


Grunt than takes all the styling from assets\css\style.css and minifies it into dist\css\style.min.css


This is the final css file
